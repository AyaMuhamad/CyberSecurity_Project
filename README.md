# CyberSecurity_Project

It is a project about hacking a site similar to Facebook that contains 18 security vulnerabilities from the OASP (which talks about the most famous vulnerabilities) and they were discovered. Within this project there are pictures of the locations of the vulnerabilities and also a file containing them all and it also contains recommendations to prevent the presence of these vulnerabilities and also to experiment with discovering them. These vulnerabilities I have placed the Ubuntu server and the virtual machine on which Kali Linux can be loaded, for example, or any tool to create a virtual copy of Linux and the server to take the IP so that you will have the ability to open this site and discover the vulnerabilities.
